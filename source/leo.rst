Low Earth orbit Satellites
==========================

Low earth orbit (LEO) Satellites are satellites which typically have an altitude of less than 2000km. They orbit the earth about 11 times a day. Depending on its orbit you can have multiple passes per day. A variety of satellites are
currently active. Some of them have FM transponders, others have SSB transponders and some only transmit beacons and/or telemetry (telemetry can also contain photos). LEO satellites are only a few minutes in view of your station so it might
take a bit of practice to work them.

Satellite Tracking Software
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Because LEO satellites are so low they orbit the earth rather quickly and its not uncommon to have multiple passes over your station. To determine the next pass of a satellite there are various software available:

Equipment
+++++++++

Its very simple to start playing with leo satellites. At the very least you would need a 2m/70cm dualband yagi antenna and a radio that can do crossband full duplex, or alternatively 2 handheld radios (on for rx and one for tx). Its usually
frowned upon to not work full duplex. Full duplex means that you can hear your own downlink while transmitting on the uplink. An antenna with two handheld radio's get you on the FM satellites. A ssb radio is required to work the ssb satellites.

If you only want to receive telemetry then an antenna + sdr works great. 

For base station antenna's you would usually look at either turnstile or antenna beater antennas. But the best setup is an azimuth/elevation rotator which can point the yagi at the satellite. You would then use software on your computer to control the rotator.
