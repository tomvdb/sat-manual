.. warning::
    If you are starting your journey playing with Amateur Radio Satellites then please keep in mind that you would an Amateur Radio license to proceed. The good news is that

Introduction
============

The concept of a satellite is not new to anyone, but unless you work for a space agency or a huge company the idea of being able to 
interact and make use of satellites in space is unbelievable to most. The truth is that due to amateur radio clubs and organizations 
around the world there are hundreds of satellites that we can play with. Anything from a small cubesat all the way to a large geosynchronous 
satellite.

While access to amateur radio satellites have been around for many years many hams are still unsure on how to get on the air and use these satellites. 
I'm still very much a newbie when it comes to amateur radio but I have a stong interest in playing with these satellites. This manual is a compilation 
of my own notes and information in the hope that it might be helpfull for other hams to get on the air with satellites. This manual is still very much a work
in progress and will be updated over time, but the idea is to focus more on the practical side of setting up your own station rather than going to deep into the theory.
If you find any errors then please feel free to let know.

.. note::
   Did you know, The first amateur radio satellite was launched in 1961. It only had a simple morse code beacon that transmitted "Hi" for three weeks before it re-entered and burnt up in the atmosphere. You can find more information about it `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSCAR_1>`_
