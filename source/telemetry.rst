Hunting Satellite Telemetry
===========================

There are lots of satellites being launched. A lot of them from univerities and amateur radio clubs. These projects don't often have the big budget having ground stations all over the world. A fun activity for amateur radio satellite enthusiasts is to track these
satellites and receive and decode the telemetry from them.
